                        <h3>Blockchain Clone</h3>
                        <p>A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer
                            network. As
                            a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains
                            are
                            best known
                            for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure
                            and
                            decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees
                            the
                            fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted
                            third
                            party.</p>

                        <p>The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but
                            not
                            edited. In
                            this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions
                            that
                            cannot
                            be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed
                            ledger
                            technology (DLT).</p>
